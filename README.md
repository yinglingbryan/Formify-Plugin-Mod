# Modified Formify Package for Concrete5

The Formify package for Concrete5 is a popular plugin to simplify form management on websites.  It basically allows custom forms to be created and dropped in any location of the website front end.  Form submissions are automatically indexed in a database for each form, and notifications can be set to automatically e-mail any number of e-mail addresses with the form data submitted.  This modification builds on this concept, and allows the integration of googleâ€™s invisible recaptcha to eliminate spam submissions.

The plugin is currently being used to manage all forms at http://www.mghus.com and http://www.mycvl.com including "Contact Us", "Schedule an Appointment", and job applications.
